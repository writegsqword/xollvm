## Goals and non-goals

### Goals

- **Production-grade integration** with LLVM NPM (PassBuilder / PassRegistry).
- **Reproducible transformations** via deterministic seeding.
- **Safety rails** to prevent runaway complexity and enable predictable build times.
- **Debuggability**: metrics, config dumps, report artifacts (CFG diffs, per-pass info).
- **Cross-arch awareness**: target-dependent techniques should be gated appropriately.

### Non-goals

- "Perfect" obfuscation. This is a toolkit; skilled analysts adapt.
- A stable security boundary. Do not rely on obfuscation alone.

## High-level architecture

</p>

### Pass registration

xollvm is **fork-free** — it registers into stock LLVM entirely from cmake flags, with zero edits
to any LLVM source file. There is no `PassRegistry.def` entry and no `PassBuilder.cpp` edit for
this project; that in-tree approach was retired when xollvm split out of the legacy `ollvm` fork
(see [the port history](../README.md) if you need the "why").

The single source of truth for registered names is `registration/ObfPasses.inc` — an x-macro
table consumed by `registration/PluginEntry.cpp`, which wires every name into `PassBuilder` via
`registerPipelineParsingCallback` (one callback for module passes, one for function passes) and
`registerAnalysisRegistrationCallback` (module + function analyses — skipping these makes the
driver assert at runtime, "analysis pass was not registered prior to being queried"). One
`PluginEntry.cpp` drives **both** build modes from the same source:

- **Static in-tree extension** (`LLVM_EXTERNAL_PROJECTS=Obfuscator` +
  `LLVM_OBFUSCATOR_LINK_INTO_TOOLS=ON`) — compiled into `clang`/`opt` directly. LLVM calls
  `getObfuscatorPluginInfo()` at startup via the generated `HANDLE_EXTENSION(Obfuscator)`. Works
  on Windows, Linux, macOS.
- **Loadable plugin** (`Obfuscator.so`, `-fpass-plugin=`/`-load-pass-plugin=`) — Linux/macOS only.
  `LLVM_OBFUSCATOR_LINK_INTO_TOOLS` is undefined in this mode, so `llvmGetPassPluginInfo()` is
  compiled in as the loadable entry (compiled *out* in static mode, so the tool never exports two
  copies).

Current registered names (`ObfPasses.inc`): module analyses `obf-annotations`, `obf-report`;
function analysis `function-obf-context`; module passes `obfuscation`, `obf-dump-config`,
`obf-metrics`, `fmerge`; function driver `obfuscation-fn`. Individual sub-passes (`mba`, `bcf`,
`vm`, ...) are not top-level `-passes=` entries — they're dispatched by `ObfuscationFunctionDriverPass`
per the pipeline (below), driven by `obf:` annotations, not by name on the `opt` command line.

There is also a clang extension-point hook: `-mllvm -enable-obfuscation` (hidden flag, default
off) injects `ObfuscationModulePass` at the start of clang's own compile pipeline. Source
annotations remain supported, while `-mllvm -obf-default-config=<spec>` applies a baseline to
every definition without rewriting source. With neither configuration source, the pass is a
no-op.

### Module entry pass

`ObfuscationModulePass` performs:

1. Fetch `ObfuscationAnnotationAnalysis` (builds `Function* → ObfuscationConfig` map).
2. Run `FunctionMergingPass` (`fmerge`) — module-only, no-ops if no function opted in. Runs
   **first** among module-only work so merged super-functions get amplified by everything after.
3. Run `StringEncryptionPass` (`strenc`) — module-only, no-ops if no function enabled it.
4. Run the function driver over all definitions.
5. Optionally write report JSON and artifacts.

### Annotation cache

`ObfuscationAnnotationAnalysis` resolves the module default and
`llvm.global.annotations` exactly once per module:

- Produces a `Function* → ObfuscationConfig` map.
- Computes module seed derivation data (module identifier, options).
- Optionally emits a seed manifest (`-obf-seed-manifest`).

The cache is accessed via `getObfCache(MAM, M)` / `getObfCache(F, FAM)` helpers.

**Parsing** (`ObfuscationConfig.cpp`):
- Tokenizer that respects parenthesis nesting.
- `passName(params...)` pattern.
- Per-pass parameter maps; aliased keys are normalised to canonical form.
- Multiple `obf:` annotations on the same function are merged (last-wins for params,
  additive for enablement).

### Function driver

`ObfuscationFunctionDriverPass` is responsible for:

- Per-function eligibility checks (declaration, instruction/block/loop-depth caps).
- Building `FuncPassCtx` (options, RNG, budget, report sink handle).
- Executing the pipeline in deterministic order (topological sort result).
- Emitting per-pass reports and CFG snapshots/diffs (when enabled).
- Invalidating analyses correctly when IR changes.
- Enforcing budget checks between each pass.

The driver is the single place to enforce policy:
- Early exits and skip reasons (recorded in report JSON).
- Deterministic seeding rules.
- Budget/limit enforcement.

### Pass pipeline ordering

Ordering is expressed as a partial order graph (`ObfuscationPipeline::getOrderingRules()`) and
topologically sorted into a stable sequence (Kahn's algorithm with a deterministic tie-break). A
canonical set of rules is enforced regardless of annotation order.

> [!WARNING]
> **Field-semantics gotcha, read before touching this table.** `PassOrderingRules` has fields
> `before`/`after`/`conflicts` — but the names describe the *listed passes' position relative to
> this row*, not this row's position. `before = {X, Y}` means **X and Y run before this pass**
> (this pass depends on them). `after = {X, Y}` means **X and Y run after this pass** (this pass
> is a prerequisite for them). Reading it as "this pass runs before/after the list" is backwards
> and is exactly the bug tracked as `NEW-13` (topo-sort had this inverted once already — fixed,
> but easy to reintroduce). Ground truth is the struct comment in
> `include/llvm/Transforms/Obfuscator/ObfuscationPipeline.h`; when in doubt, read that, not this
> table from memory.

| Pass | Runs after (prerequisites) | Runs before (dependents) | Conflicts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fmerge` | — (module-only, runs before the function pipeline entirely) | display/meta-order only: everything | — |
| `constenc` | — | `mba`, `substitution`, `vcall`, `split`, `sdiff`, `bcf`, `flattening`, `shield` | — |
| `mba` | — | `substitution`, `split`, `bcf`, `flattening` | — |
| `substitution` | `mba` | `split`, `bcf`, `flattening` | — |
| `split` | `mba`, `substitution` | `bcf`, `flattening` | — |
| `sdiff` | `mba`, `substitution`, `split` | `bcf`, `flattening` | — |
| `bcf` | `mba`, `substitution`, `split`, `sdiff` | `flattening` | — |
| `flattening` | `mba`, `substitution`, `split`, `sdiff`, `bcf` | `vcall`, `adec` | `vm` |
| `vcall` | `mba`, `split`, `sdiff`, `bcf`, `flattening` | — | — |
| `shield` | `mba`, `substitution`, `split`, `sdiff`, `bcf`, `vcall`, `flattening` | `adec` | — |
| `strenc` | `mba`, `substitution`, `split`, `sdiff`, `bcf`, `vcall`, `flattening`, `shield` (display/meta-order only — actually module-only, runs before the function pipeline) | `adec` | — |
| `adec` | `mba`, `substitution`, `split`, `sdiff`, `bcf`, `vcall`, `flattening`, `shield`, `strenc` | — | — |
| `vm` | `mba`, `substitution`, `split`, `sdiff`, `bcf` | `vcall`, `shield`, `adec` | `flattening` |

Note the two ordering-sensitive facts most likely to surprise: **`vcall` runs *after*
`flattening`**, not before (flattening bails out on functions that already contain indirect
calls, so sequencing flattening first lets both coexist in combo pipelines) — and **`vm` runs
*before* `vcall`**, because `vm` builds a static callee table at compile time and can't handle
calls that `vcall` has already turned indirect.

`vm` **must not run together with `flattening`** — both restructure the entire CFG. The pipeline
driver rejects this combination.

### Deterministic seeding

Seeding is hierarchical:

- **Base seed**: from `-obf-seed`.
- **Module seed**:
  - if `-obf-seed != 0`: use the base seed directly.
  - else if `-obf-deterministic`: hash the module identifier.
  - else: `std::random_device` (non-reproducible).
- **Function seed**: `mix(moduleSeed, stableHash(F.getName()))`.
- **Pass seed**: `deriveSeed(functionSeed, passIdString)`.

This enables:
- Reproducible builds (fixed seed).
- Reproducible debugging even without an explicit seed (deterministic mode).
- Controlled per-pass randomness without cross-contamination between passes or functions.

### IR growth budgeting

`IRBudget` provides a per-function instruction growth limit:

```
Limit = clamp(insts_before × multiplier, 1, hardcap)
```

Each pass consumes from the remaining budget as the instruction count grows.
When the budget is exhausted (or the hard cap is hit), later passes in the pipeline
may be skipped. Budget state and utilization are recorded in the report JSON.

Global knobs: `-obf-ir-budget-multiplier` (default 50×), `-obf-ir-budget-max` (default 0 = no hard cap).

---

## Reporting system

The reporting system answers:

- *Which passes ran or were skipped, and why?*
- *How much did the IR grow?*
- *Where did the CFG change?*
- *Which transforms contributed to "difficulty" for a reverse engineer?*

### What gets recorded

**Per function:**

- Resolved seeds: base, module, function.
- Instruction counts before and after.
- Budget: limit, remaining, utilization percentage.
- Per-pass entries: `ran`/`skipped`, seed, `changed` flag, instruction deltas, skip reason.
- Difficulty score: cyclomatic delta, opaque predicate count, MBA node/depth stats,
  indirect branches, callbr count, indirect call count.

CFG artifacts are emitted when `-obf-report-dir` is set.

### JSON schema

Output path: `-obf-report-json=<path>` **or** `<report_dir>/obf_report.json`.

Root object:

```jsonc
{
  "schema": "llvm_obfuscator.obf_map",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "module": {
    "identifier": "string",
    "source_file": "string",      // optional
    "target_triple": "string",    // optional
    "data_layout": "string"       // optional
  },
  "functions": [ /* FunctionReport[] */ ]
}
```

Each `FunctionReport`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "string",
  "declaration": false,
  "skipped": false,
  "skip_reason": "string",        // present when skipped=true
  "seed": {

    "function": 0
  },
  "insts": { "before": 0, "after": 0 },

        "diff_dot":  "cfg/fn/per_pass/mba/diff.dot"  // optional
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When adding new fields, bump `schema_version` and maintain backward-compatible defaults
> for any consumers that parse the JSON.

### CFG snapshot/diff artifacts

When `-obf-report-dir` is set, DOT files are written as:

```
cfg/<function>/before.dot
cfg/<function>/after.dot
cfg/<function>/per_pass/<passId>/after.dot
cfg/<function>/per_pass/<passId>/diff.dot   (optional)
```

The diff graph colour-codes added/removed blocks and edges relative to the previous snapshot,
providing an at-a-glance view of which pass caused which CFG change.

### HTML generator

`llvm/utils/obfuscator/obf_report_html.py` consumes `obf_report.json` and emits a single
self-contained HTML file.

Available renderers (`--renderer`):

| Mode | Requirement | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `dot` (recommended) | Graphviz `dot` in PATH | Inline SVG, offline-friendly |
| `wasm` | HTTP server (MIME type requirements) | Client-side Graphviz WASM |
| `text` | None | Metadata tables only, no graphs |

---

## Correctness hardening

### PreservedAnalyses contract

The driver treats "changed" as `!PA.areAllPreserved()`.

Every obfuscation pass **must**:

- Return `PreservedAnalyses::all()` when it truly did not mutate IR.
- Return `PreservedAnalyses::none()` (or an accurate subset) when it did.

Incorrect preservation causes stale analyses to be reused, corrupts the "changed" signal in
reports, and can introduce subtle correctness bugs.

### SSA repair

Complex CFG transforms and instruction substitutions can break SSA invariants.
`ObfRepairSSA` exists to:

- Ensure PHI nodes are consistent with their predecessor edges.
- Re-insert PHI nodes when blocks are split or rewired.
- Clean up dead blocks where safe.

Best practices:
- Run repair after any heavy CFG transform.
- Keep repair deterministic (sort keys, stable iteration order).
- The pipeline driver marks `NeedsSSARepair = true` for passes that need it
  (notably `vm`).

### EH and invoke/callbr considerations

- `invoke` edges and EH funclets require extra care (WinEH, Itanium EH).
- `callbr` has special CFG semantics (asm-goto).
- Transforms should avoid touching EH pads and `callbr` blocks unless explicitly supported.

When in doubt:
- Gate transforms on `F.hasPersonalityFn()` / `hasEHFunclets()`.
- Keep `allowInvoke`-style toggles conservative (default off).
- `vm` explicitly rejects functions with EH pads, `invoke`, `callbr`, or `indirectbr`.

### Debug info handling

Options:

- `-obf-strip-debug`: remove debug metadata (explicit opt-in).
- `-obf-debug-synthetic`: mark inserted instructions as synthetic debug info where possible.

The `DebugInfoPreserver` utility should be used by passes that:
- Clone instructions.
- Move blocks around (flattening, splitting).
- Rewrite call sites.

---

## Adding a new obfuscation pass

There are 7 mandatory touch-points (source, CMake, `PassIds.h`, `registration/ObfPasses.inc`,
`ObfuscationConfig`, `ObfuscationPipeline`, runtime tests) — miss one and the pass either doesn't
build, builds but never runs, or runs but is unreachable via annotation. The full checklist,
exact file:function anchors, and the current wiring bugs to grep for afterward live in the
`xollvm-add-pass` skill (`.claude/skills/xollvm-add-pass/`) rather than duplicated here — that
copy is the one to trust and update; this doc intentionally doesn't keep a second one.

In short: implement as an NPM function pass or module pass with correct `PreservedAnalyses`; add
a config struct to `ObfuscationConfig.h/.cpp` (model after an existing one — read the field, not
this sentence, for the current pattern); register the canonical ID + aliases in `PassIds.h`;
register the pass itself in `registration/ObfPasses.inc`; wire ordering + dispatch in
`ObfuscationPipeline.cpp` (see the field-semantics warning above — this is the single most common
place new passes go wrong); extend the runtime suite in `utils/cases/` + `utils/gates/`, never as
a standalone test file.

---

## The VM pass — implementation overview

The VM pass is architecturally distinct from all other passes because it **replaces the entire
function body** rather than transforming individual instructions or edges. A full dedicated
reference is in [VM.md](VM.md); this section focuses on the implementation structure.

### Module-level shared engine

To minimise binary size overhead when multiple functions are virtualised, all opcode handlers
(56 as of `OP_COUNT = 0x38` in `VMPass_ISA.h` — check that constant directly, it grows with every
new fused/decoy/stack opcode and this doc will drift again) live in a module-level function
`__vm_engine()`. With `enginePoolSize > 1` there are `N` structurally-independent engines instead
of one shared one (see hardening layers below). Each engine is created once per module (by
`VMEngine::getOrBuildVMEngine`) and populated on first use (`VMEngine::populateVMEngine` /
`hardenVMEngine`).

`__vm_engine` has a canonical 18-parameter signature (`VMEngine::getVMEngineFunctionType`):

```
void @__vm_engine(
    ptr  %bc,         // bytecode pointer
    i32  %bc_len,     // bytecode length
    ptr  %regs,       // [N×i32] integer register file
    ptr  %regs64,     // [N×i64] 64-bit register file
    ptr  %fregs,      // [N×double] float register file
    ptr  %pregs,      // [N×ptr] pointer register file
    ptr  %callees,    // callee address table
    i32  %salt,       // compile-time seed (volatile)
    i32  %regMask,    // nextPow2(NVR)-1
    i32  %reg64Mask,  // nextPow2(NVR64)-1
    i32  %fregMask,   // nextPow2(NFR)-1
    i32  %pregMask,   // nextPow2(NPR)-1
    ptr  %handlers,   // per-function permuted handler table
    ptr  %fty_indices,// per-function callee FunctionType index table
    ptr  %regkeys,    // per-slot i32 XOR keys (null = off)
    ptr  %reg64keys,  // per-slot i64 XOR keys (null = off)
    ptr  %fregkeys,   // per-slot f64-as-i64 XOR keys (null = off)
    i64  %callee_mask // per-slot callee XOR masks
)
```

Each virtualised function becomes a **thin wrapper** that tail-calls `__vm_engine` with its
own per-function globals (bytecode, register files, handler table).

### Per-function wrapper and globals

Three globals are emitted per virtualised function:

| Global | Type | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `@fn.vm.bytecode` | `[L × i8]` private constant | Encrypted bytecode stream |
| `@fn.vm.ophandlers` | `[OP_COUNT × ptr]` private constant | Permuted handler-address table |
| `@fn.vm.callees` | `[C × ptr]` private constant | Callee address table |

The function body is stripped and replaced with allocas for the four register files, then a
tail call to `__vm_engine` carrying the per-function globals.

### Compilation pipeline (VMImpl)

`VMImpl::run()` executes the following phases:

1. **Eligibility check** (`isVMEligible`) — rejects EH, callbr, indirectbr, naked, block count.
2. **PHI demotion** — all PHI nodes are demoted to `alloca`/`load`/`store` pairs in a dedicated
   entry block, because the bytecode has no PHI concept.
3. **Slot assignment (Pass 1)** — `BytecodeEmitter::run()` first pass: assign integer (vreg),
   64-bit (vreg64), float (freg), and pointer (preg) register slots to every SSA value in
   declaration order. Arguments first, then entry allocas, then remaining defs.
4. **Bytecode emission (Pass 2)** — `BytecodeEmitter::run()` second pass: emit opcode bytes.
   Register-index bytes are XOR'd with `SaltConst` when `obfRegIdx=1`. Forward branch targets
   are patched after the full block walk.
5. **IR construction** (`buildBytecodeGlobal`, `buildCalleeGlobal`, `buildVMEntry`,
   `buildOpcodeHandlers`, `buildHandlerTable`, `buildDispatch`) — construct all IR.
6. **Encryption** (`buildEncryptCtorAES` or `buildEncryptCtorLCG`) — emit `.init_array`
   constructor for layer-2 bytecode encryption.
7. **Hardening** (when `hardened=1`): wrapper hardening (`hardenWrapper`, `mbaHardenWrapper`,
   `flattenWrapper`), engine hardening (`hardenVMEngine`), anti-debug (`buildAntiDebugGate`),
   integrity hash (`buildIntegrityHashCtor`), callee XOR masking (`buildCalleeXorCtor`).

### Opcode permutation

Each virtualised function gets a **unique logical↔physical opcode bijection** (`VMOpcodeMap`),
generated by Fisher-Yates shuffle seeded from the per-function RNG. The physical handler table
stored in `@fn.vm.ophandlers` is indexed by *physical* byte, so two functions cannot share the
same dispatch-table layout — defeating cross-function opcode signature matching.

### Hardening layers

**The knob set here is large (~20 fields on `VMPassConfig` as of this writing — register-index
XOR, bytecode encryption, lazy per-fetch decrypt, register-value XOR with optional rolling key,
handler-body polymorphism + decoys, nested virtualization, threaded/keyed dispatch, opcode
fusion, per-build ISA randomization, engine pooling + per-engine metamorphism, anti-debug gates,
integrity hashing, ...) and grows with every shipped hardening arc — do not hand-maintain a copy
of it here.** Read `struct VMPassConfig` in `ObfuscationConfig.h` directly for the current field
list with inline comments, and see [VM.md](VM.md) for the user-facing per-knob reference
(parameters, defaults, presets) — that file is what gets updated at ship time and is the one to
trust for "what does knob X do today."

What's structurally true regardless of which knobs are on: independent hardening layers compose
(register-index obfuscation, bytecode encryption, register-value encryption, and handler
polymorphism are each separately toggleable and mostly orthogonal), every knob defaults OFF and
is byte-identical when off, and `preset=` annotations (e.g. `preset=max`) opt into a curated
bundle rather than requiring every knob spelled out by hand.

## Coding guidelines

### Determinism

- Never rely on hash-map iteration order for transformation order.
  - Sort `SmallVector` lists by stable keys (e.g., block name / index).
- Fork randomness only from the provided `Rng` / seed derivation APIs (`deriveSeed`).
- Keep report output deterministic (sort functions by name, use stable path separators).

### Performance

- Avoid quadratic behavior on block graphs.
  - Cap "candidate sites" early.
  - Honour the IR budget between passes.
- Prefer `SmallVector` / `SmallDenseMap` where the expected sizes are small.
- Do not call expensive analyses repeatedly; cache results in `FunctionObfContext`.

### Diagnostics

- Keep skip reasons explicit and actionable (size limits, budget exhaustion, unsupported IR patterns).
- Prefer structured output:
  - `obf-dump-config` for config visibility.
  - Report JSON for machine-readable debugging.
- When adding new report fields, bump `schema_version` and keep backward-compatible defaults.
- New passes should emit a `skip_reason` whenever they decide not to transform a function so
  that the report accurately reflects intent vs. actual execution.
